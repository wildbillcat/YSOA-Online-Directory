				I understand that there is a <strong>high risk of fire</strong> when using the laser cutters, and I WILL NOT leave the machine unattended while cutting.
			</li>
			<li>
				I understand that guidelines for laser cutter use are posted in every laser cutter room.  I will review these guidelines before doing any laser cutting, and I will not use the laser cutter to cut prohibited materials.  If I have questions about whether a material is suitable for use in the laser cutter, I will ask the Digital Media office.
			<li>
				I understand that laser cutter operating hours are between 8:00AM and 12:00AM, and that use the cutters outside of these hours is prohibited.  Violators will be reported to the Dean's Office for disciplinary action.<br />
				<strong>Note:</strong> The operational hours for the the shop industrial laser cutter are controlled by the shopâ€™s electrical equipment lockouts; this laser cutter will therefore operate on a slightly different operational schedule.
			</li>
			<li>
				I will not sit, lean, or hand-cut on top of the laser cutters, as this can damage the plexiglass view screen; I understand that doing so will make me liable for the cost of repairing any damage I cause.  I understand that a cutting table has been provided in each laser cutter room for hand-cutting use.   
			</li>
			<li>
				I will notify the Digital Media office if I find or cause damage to the laser cutters, and will not use a cutter if it has visible damage, such as cracks or holes in the plexiglass view screen.

			</li>
			<li>
				I understand that I am responsible for the charges for all laser cutter jobs sent under my printing account, including charges for jobs done on a machine that I left logged in with my credentials or those done by another person to whom I have given my credentials.
			</li>
			<li>
				I understand that the laser cutters can be reserved online for a maximum of ONE hour per day per laser cutter, for a maximum of two consecutive days at a time; and that any violation of this policy may result in the deletion of any offending reservations and loss of my access to the reservation system.
			</li>
			<li>
